Hello, 
This is the GitHub of Adrien Molines
I am a new PhD student at ETHZ, working in the Beisert group of the ITP. I will be working mainly with my advisor, Dr. Sibylle Driezen.
My focus will be integrability in string theory, more specifcally focusing on integrable deformations of string sigma models

Although I am just starting, the first project I will work on will be to obtain the spin chain regularisation of coset sigma-models deformed 
by the homegenous Yang-Baxter integrable deformation.
